### From Curiosity to Cybersecurity and Beyond : My Journey

I got my interest in IT and security after reading about "hacking" for the first time during a computer class in the 10th grade. Intrigued, I explored this field by performing some attempts of ethical phishing on my friends just to see how they were implemented.

By the time I reached 12th grade, my curiosity had grown significantly. I started working with Linux systems and eventually got into Kali Linux, where I explored its powerful tools. I gained hands-on knowledge of various attack vectors like phishing, XSS (Cross-Site Scripting), SQL injection, and creating payloads. I also started buying old mobile phones, rooting them, and repurposing them as hosting servers for my projects, which gave me practical experience in configuring servers and running services.

In payload generation and server hosting, I learned about the significance of port forwarding and NAT concepts in networking, which further deepened my understanding of how systems actually communicate. This phase really helped me settle my interest in IT and security.

I learned further in my BCom about cloud computing and even wrote a paper on what the future was for cloud computing, including my vision of and understanding toward the field.

I am now focusing in my MCA on a broader range, including programming, development, cybersecurity, and my prime interests: DevOps, full-stack development, and cybersecurity. I am gaining expertise day by day and trying to bridge the gap between development and operations, security, and cloud technologies.

My passion to learn, test, and construct practical solutions has been the propelling force of my journey so far.
